### Project Overview

The project focuses on extracting insights from a raw dataset containing weekly sales data from a series of stores over a span of three years. Each store was originally identified by a numerical code, which has been replaced with a United States state for convenience. 

Upon extracting the pertinent information, pivot tables were created to concentrate on what could be the most compelling insights, including:
- Sales across quarters
- Sales during holiday weeks versus non-holiday weeks
- Sales per individual state
- Sales by sector and subcategories (invented for analytical purposes)

All findings are presented within a dynamic dashboard for ease of analysis and visualization. This project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the sales data to inform strategic decision-making processes.

### Data Sources


Sales Data: The Primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv". Unfortunately i had to split the files to comply with the allowed size


### Tools

- MS Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation


In the initial data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks:
- Data Loading and inspection;
- Handling missing values;
- Data Cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which product are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?


### Data Analysis
Data Analysis done entirely with Excel (VLOOKUP + INDEX-MATCH + PIVOT TABLES + SLICING)


### Results Findings
The results findings from the analysis are as follows:

1. *Quarterly Sales Trends*: Identified fluctuations and patterns in sales volume across different quarters over the three-year period, enabling better understanding of seasonal trends and potential opportunities for sales optimization.

2. *Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Sales*: Highlighted variances in sales performance between holiday weeks and non-holiday weeks, providing insights into consumer behavior during peak shopping periods versus regular weeks.

3. *Regional Sales Performance*: Examined sales data for each state, revealing geographical disparities in sales performance and potentially identifying areas for targeted marketing or operational improvements.

4. *Sector and Subcategory Analysis*: Analyzed sales by sector and subcategories, even though they were invented, to understand which product categories drive overall sales performance and identify potential areas for product diversification or promotional efforts.

These findings collectively provide stakeholders with valuable insights into the dynamics of sales performance across different dimensions, empowering informed decision-making and strategic planning to enhance overall business outcomes.

### Recommendations
- develop targeted marketing campaigns with seasonal sales trends in order to maximixe sales opportunities.
- region-specific strategies
- Continuos monitoring and adaptation: adapt strategies accordingly to stay responsive to changing market dynamics and consumer trends.
