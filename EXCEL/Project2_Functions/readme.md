## EXCEL: PROJECT 2
  <div id="header" align="left">

In this Excel file, I wanted to showcase the functions that I use most frequently in my daily work. 
In "working sheet", the columns I created from the raw dataset using the highlighted functions are marked.
Then, as with Project 1, I continued the data analysis with a pivot table and, finally, represented everything with an interactive dashboard.
