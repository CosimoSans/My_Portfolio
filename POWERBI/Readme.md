## PowerBI: Project 1

For this Power BI project, I considered the results of a survey regarding the data analyst profession and created a dashboard suggesting what I believe to be the most relevant information:
* It is a profession for both genders: there are no significant differences between men and women.
* It is a profession that allows for a good work-life balance.
* The salary does not satisfy everyone, probably mainly in the American market, where it is experiencing a moderate crisis.
* SQL is not considered a programming language ðŸ˜„
