# Cosimo Sansone Data Analyst Portfolio

### About me

I'm a banking sector analyst who would like to become a data analyst.

This portfolio was created to showcase my skills and progress in data analysis.

During my studies, I came into contact with this discipline, and since then, 
I've enjoyed exploring new analysis techniques, which I aim to demonstrate here.
